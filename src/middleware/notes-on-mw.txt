Middleware functions are typically (although not always) passed through by all HTTP requests
and do not fulfill the request, unless it's a case of returning an error response early.

--> Example: only show list of friends after user has authorized:
app.get('/api/items', (authorize), (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.user); // cool: now we can log the user info when the items page is accessed
  res.send('items')
})

It's the controller that ultimately *fulfills* the request with a successful response.
