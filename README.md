# Friend Reminder App

Early version of a contact list app, to be further developed later.

The main purpose of this early version is for training: to gain experience in the basics of Node.js/Express.js, as well as best practices for software projects (testing/TDD, deployment, etc.).

This training project was not developed following any specific tutorial or course.

## Prerequisites
* Node.js v19.8.1
* npm v8.1.2

## Dependencies
This project uses the following dependencies:
* Express v4.18.2
* Nodemon v2.0.22
* ESLint v8.37.0
* Jest v29.5.0
* Supertest v6.3.3

## How to run

Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
Run the tests with `npm test`. This will execute the test suite using Jest.
Run the project locally with `npm start`.

To run the project with Nodemon, use `npm run dev`.
This will start the application using a development server that automatically reloads the server when changes are made to the code.
