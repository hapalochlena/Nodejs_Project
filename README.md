Early version of a contact list app, to be further developed later.

The main purpose of this early version is for training: to gain experience in the basics of Node.js/Express.js, as well as best practices for software projects (testing/TDD, deployment, etc.)

This training project was not developed following any specific tutorial or course, but rather through freely implementing previously gained knowledge.
